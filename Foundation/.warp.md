# Augment Agent Workflow Guidelines

_Last Updated: 2025-08-04_

## Overview

This document establishes the workflow for Augment Agent when working on the my-better-t-app project. It ensures consistency, maintains documentation alignment, and preserves project context across conversations.

**üìã Documentation Structure**: The .kiro/steering/ directory is now organized into Current State Documentation (‚úÖ what exists) and Development Guidelines (üîÑ future patterns). Always check `.kiro/steering/README.md` for navigation guidance.

## 1. Conversation Initialization Protocol

### Required .kiro Review (Execute in Order)

1. **Documentation Navigation**

   - Start with `.kiro/steering/README.md` for documentation structure overview
   - Understand the distinction between current state docs (‚úÖ) and future guidelines (üîÑ)

2. **Current State Assessment**

   - Read `.kiro/steering/current-state.md` to understand what actually exists
   - Read `.kiro/steering/MAIN.md` for core principles and coding standards
   - Read `.kiro/steering/tech.md` for technology stack and commands

3. **Epic Context (If Working on Specific Features)**

   - Identify relevant epic in `.kiro/specs/`
   - Read epic's `requirement.md` for goals and scope
   - Read epic's `design.md` for implementation approach
   - Read epic's `tasks.md` for current progress and next steps

4. **Development Guidelines Context**
   - Read `.kiro/steering/structure.md` for project organization
   - Read `.kiro/steering/development.md` for workflow guidelines
   - Read relevant future implementation guides ONLY when implementing new features:
     - `api-best-practices.md` for backend work (üîÑ future patterns)
     - `ui-best-practices.md` for frontend work (üîÑ future patterns)
     - `database-best-practices.md` for data layer work (üîÑ future patterns)
     - `testing-best-practices.md` for test-related work (üîÑ future patterns)

### Information Gathering Commands

```bash
# Always start with these commands after .kiro review
codebase-retrieval: "current implementation status of [specific area]"
git-commit-retrieval: "recent changes related to [work area]"
```

## 2. Development Workflow

### Before Making Any Code Changes

1. **Validate Current State**

   - Use `codebase-retrieval` to understand existing patterns
   - Check `.kiro/steering/current-state.md` accuracy
   - Identify any gaps between documentation and reality

2. **Plan with Task Management**

   - For complex work (>30 minutes), use task management tools
   - Break work into ~20-minute professional developer tasks
   - Reference epic `tasks.md` files for context

3. **Follow Established Patterns**
   - Respect existing code architecture and patterns
   - Follow `.kiro/steering/MAIN.md` coding standards
   - Use appropriate package managers (never edit package files directly)

### During Development

1. **Incremental Progress**

   - Make small, focused changes
   - Update task states as work progresses
   - Test changes immediately after implementation

2. **Documentation Alignment**
   - Update `.kiro/steering/current-state.md` when adding new features
   - Update epic `tasks.md` files when completing tasks
   - Note any deviations from planned design in epic `design.md`

## 3. Documentation Maintenance Protocol

### When to Update .kiro Documents

#### `.kiro/steering/current-state.md`

- **Add** new implemented features to "What Actually Exists"
- **Remove** items from "What Doesn't Exist Yet" when implemented
- **Update** environment setup status when configuration changes
- **Revise** "Next Logical Steps" based on current progress

#### Epic `tasks.md` Files

- **Mark complete** when tasks are finished and tested
- **Add new tasks** when scope expands or issues are discovered
- **Update descriptions** when implementation differs from plan
- **Note blockers** when dependencies are discovered

#### Epic `design.md` Files

- **Document** significant architectural decisions made during implementation
- **Update** when technical approach changes from original plan
- **Add** lessons learned and implementation notes

#### Best Practice Documents

- **Add examples** of patterns successfully implemented
- **Update** when new tools or approaches are adopted
- **Document** common pitfalls discovered during development

### Documentation Update Triggers

- ‚úÖ New feature implemented ‚Üí Update `current-state.md`
- ‚úÖ Task completed ‚Üí Update epic `tasks.md`
- ‚úÖ Architecture decision made ‚Üí Update epic `design.md`
- ‚úÖ New pattern established ‚Üí Update relevant best-practices document
- ‚úÖ Environment change ‚Üí Update `current-state.md` environment section

## 3.1 Documentation Categories and Usage

### Current State Documentation (‚úÖ Reflects Reality)

These documents accurately reflect what is currently implemented:

- `current-state.md`: Comprehensive audit of what exists vs what doesn't
- `tech.md`: Technology stack, versions, and command reference
- `structure.md`: Project file organization and naming conventions
- `MAIN.md`: Coding standards and rules applicable to current code

### Development Guidelines (üîÑ Future Implementation Guides)

These documents provide patterns for future development:

- `development.md`: Workflow and project standards
- `api-best-practices.md`: Patterns to follow when implementing API features
- `ui-best-practices.md`: Patterns to follow when implementing UI components
- `database-best-practices.md`: Patterns to follow when implementing database models
- `testing-best-practices.md`: Testing setup and patterns for future implementation

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: Future implementation guides contain patterns that may not exist yet. Always verify current implementation status in `current-state.md` before using these patterns.

## 4. Quality Assurance Checklist

### Before Completing Any Work

- [ ] Code follows `.kiro/steering/MAIN.md` standards
- [ ] Changes align with epic `design.md` approach
- [ ] Tests written and passing (suggest if not existing)
- [ ] Documentation updated to reflect current reality
- [ ] Task states updated in epic `tasks.md`
- [ ] `current-state.md` reflects new implementation status

### Code Quality Standards

- Use TypeScript strictly (no `any` types)!
- Follow accessibility guidelines from MAIN.md
- Implement proper error handling patterns
- Use established project patterns and conventions
- Ensure mobile responsiveness for UI changes

## 5. Communication Guidelines

### With Users

- **Be Direct**: Skip flattery, provide actionable information
- **Be Conservative**: Ask before potentially damaging actions
- **Be Specific**: Reference exact files and line numbers when discussing code
- **Be Helpful**: Suggest testing and validation steps

### Documentation Style

- **Be Accurate**: Only document what actually exists
- **Be Specific**: Include exact commands, file paths, and examples
- **Be Current**: Always update timestamps when modifying documents
- **Be Actionable**: Provide clear next steps and commands

## 6. Emergency Protocols

### When Documentation is Inaccurate

1. Immediately note discrepancies in conversation
2. Update `current-state.md` to reflect reality
3. Investigate git history to understand when divergence occurred
4. Update related epic documentation if needed

### When Stuck or Going in Circles

1. Ask user for clarification or help
2. Review .kiro documents for missed context
3. Use `git-commit-retrieval` to find similar past solutions
4. Consider if task breakdown needs refinement

### When Major Architecture Changes are Needed

1. Document the need in epic `design.md`
2. Update epic `requirement.md` if scope changes
3. Get user approval before proceeding
4. Update multiple .kiro documents to maintain consistency

## 7. File Naming and Organization

### When Creating New .kiro Documents

- Use descriptive, hyphenated names (e.g., `new-feature-patterns.md`)
- Place in appropriate subdirectory (`specs/`, `steering/`, or `hooks/`)
- Include creation date and purpose in document header
- Reference from other relevant documents

### When Working with Epic Documentation

- Never create new epics without user direction
- Always work within existing epic structure
- Update all three files (`requirement.md`, `design.md`, `tasks.md`) when epic scope changes

## 8. Success Metrics

### Conversation Success Indicators

- .kiro documents consulted before major decisions
- Code changes align with documented patterns
- Documentation updated to reflect current state
- User receives accurate, actionable guidance
- Project maintains consistency across conversations

### Documentation Health Indicators

- `current-state.md` accurately reflects codebase
- Epic `tasks.md` files show clear progress
- Best practice documents contain working examples
- No contradictions between .kiro documents
- Clear distinction maintained between current state (‚úÖ) and future guidelines (üîÑ)
- `.kiro/steering/README.md` provides accurate navigation guidance

## 9. .kiro Directory Cross-Reference

### Key .kiro Documents for Context

- **Navigation**: `.kiro/steering/README.md` - Start here for documentation overview
- **Current Reality**: `.kiro/steering/current-state.md` - What actually exists right now
- **Technology**: `.kiro/steering/tech.md` - Stack details and commands
- **Standards**: `.kiro/steering/MAIN.md` - Coding rules and quality standards
- **Workflow**: `.kiro/steering/development.md` - Development process guidelines
- **Architecture**: `.kiro/steering/structure.md` - Project organization

### Epic Documentation Pattern

Each epic in `.kiro/specs/` follows this structure:

- `requirement.md` - Goals, scope, and acceptance criteria
- `design.md` - Technical approach and architecture decisions
- `tasks.md` - Implementation tasks and progress tracking

### Documentation Maintenance Protocol

1. Always check `.kiro/steering/current-state.md` first to understand what exists
2. Use future implementation guides only when implementing new features
3. Update current state documentation when features are completed
4. Cross-reference between .kiro documents to maintain consistency
5. Follow the clear categorization: Current State (‚úÖ) vs Future Guidelines (üîÑ)
