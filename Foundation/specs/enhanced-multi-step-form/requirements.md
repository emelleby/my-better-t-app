## Introduction

This specification outlines the enhancement of the existing multi-step form component to create a comprehensive sustainability reporting form.

5. WHEN initiative data is incomplete THEN the system SHALL validate required fields before allowing form submission
6. WHEN the user submits the form THEN the system SHALL include only selected initiatives with complete data

### Requirement 4: Enhanced Form Navigation and Progress Tracking

**User Story:** As a form user, I want clear navigation and progress indication, so that I can understand my position in the form and navigate efficiently.

5. WHEN the form is submitted THEN the system SHALL provide clear success confirmation accessible to all users

### Requirement 6: Data Persistence and Recovery
