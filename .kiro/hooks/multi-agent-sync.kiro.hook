Please analyze all .md files in this directory and synchronize the agent configurations:\n\n1. **Extract Core Information** from all steering documents:\n   - Project structure and technology stack\n   - Development guidelines and conventions  \n   - Code quality rules and accessibility standards\n   - Testing and deployment practices\n\n2. **Update Agent-Specific Configurations**:\n   - **Claude Code**: Update `.claude/CLAUDE.md` with comprehensive project context\n   - **Cursor**: Update `.cursor/rules` with concise development rules\n   - **Windsurf**: Update `.windsurfrules` with structured guidelines\n\n3. **Ensure Consistency**:\n   - Maintain identical core principles across all agents\n   - Adapt format and verbosity to each agent's standards\n   - Preserve agent-specific configuration patterns\n\nFocus on creating configurations that reflect the current state of the project and provide clear, actionable guidance for each AI assistant. For CLAUDE.md and .windsurfrules, mak sure to crossreference and give the agent a place to look up additional context in the Foundation/steering/ directory. For Cursor, keep the rules brief and to the point. make sure to organize information according to how cursor expect rules to be formatted and described."
